#### Why Redux Toolkit
1. Action types are difficult to maintain
2. Store becoming too big
3. Mistakenly editing store
4. Reducer becoming too big


#### Working with Redux Toolkit
1. Npminstall @reduxjs/toolkit
2. Remove redux from package.json
3. Import {createSlice} from “@reduxjs/toolkit”
4. Slices of the store can be created using the following syntax:
    Const slice = createSlice({
        name: ‘’,
        initialState: {},  
        reducers: {
        smallReducerMethods: (state, action) => {
        },
        }
    })
5. ConfigureStore combines multiple reducers and can be used as: 
    configureStore({
        reducer: {name: slice.reducer}
    })
6. Export actions = slice.actions;
7. Actions can be dispatched like: actions.reducerMethod(payload);
