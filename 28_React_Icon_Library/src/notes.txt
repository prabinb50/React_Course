// How React Works
Root Component: 
    • The App is the main or root component of a React application.
    • It's the starting point of your React component tree.

Virtual DOM:
    • React creates an in-memory structure called the virtual DOM.
    • Different from the actual browser DOM.
    • It's a lightweight representation where each node stands for a component and its attributes.

Reconciliation Process:
    • When component data changes, React updates the virtual DOM's state to mirror these changes.
    • React then compares the current and previous versions of the virtual DOM.
    • It identifies the specific nodes that need updating.
    • Only these nodes are updated in the real browser DOM, making it efficient.
