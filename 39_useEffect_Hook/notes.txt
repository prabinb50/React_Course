1. In function-based components, useEffect handles 
side effects like data fetching or event listeners.
 2. useEffect runs automatically after every render by 
default.
 3. By providing a dependency array, useEffect will only 
run when specified variables change. An empty array 
means the effect runs once.
 4. Multiple useEffect hooks can be used in a single 
component for organizing different side effects 
separately.
